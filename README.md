Website for Voltage and Current Calculations for NPN Transistor

This project is a tool for studying NPN transistor
- Makes calculations for common collector transistors
- Makes calculations for common emitter transistor

About this project:
This project was developed when I was studying Analog Electronics, and to study Transistors several calculations are necessary, so to facilitate
my life to solve exercises and make reports on electronics practices, I developed this project. This project helped me and all my colleagues to
learn transistors and document electronics practices.
